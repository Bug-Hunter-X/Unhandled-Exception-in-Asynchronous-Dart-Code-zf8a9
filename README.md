# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: unhandled exceptions in asynchronous operations.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that simulates an asynchronous operation that might throw an exception. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  This example highlights the importance of using try-catch blocks when working with asynchronous code to prevent unexpected crashes and improve application stability.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Dart IDE (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Run the `bug.dart` and `bugSolution.dart` files separately to observe the difference in exception handling.
